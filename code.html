      % begin{center} just puts your table in the centre of the page... fairly obvious
      \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}  % these are lower case L not ones (can you tell a difference: l 1 ? stupid innit? anyway i think they put your content in the cells to the left, so 'c' would be centre and 'r' should be right... i think
          \hline % just keep this here
          \textbf{Colour} & $\bm{\lambda_{exp}}$ & $\bm{\lambda_{lit}}$    \\ \hline  %textbf just makes ur txt bold.. the & signify the cell border
          Purple & 448 & 447  \\ \hline %e.g. Purple | 448 | 447
          Blue & 468 & 471    \\ \hline % just keep these \\ \hline.. dunno what it does, dont either care
          Blue-Green & 487 & 492 \\ \hline %enjoy deleting these commments.. hope they're not too confusing
